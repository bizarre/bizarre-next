# about me

Hey there! I'm Alex, a ~~software engineer~~ wizard based in [Vancouver, BC]().

###### Tinkerer

I'm interested in open source, decentralization, and rust.

I was most recently an engineer at [Studio](https://studio.com), a learning startup, where I helped ship `chat` and `creative profiles`.

I co-founded a startup at the beginning of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) in an attempt to redefine movie night. _The startup ultimately didn't succeed, but we're revisiting the core concept as an [open source project](/repositories/tsanga/orbt) now!_

###### Photography

I have been shooting photography as a hobby for the past five years. I currently rock a [Sony α7 III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_α7_III) and a couple Sigma primes.

I'm interested in experimental photography, but you'll typically catch me shooting basic street photography in downtown Vancouver.

###### Music

I have been trying to teach myself guitar for a _very_ long time. I love playing blues and jazzy riffs, and I find myself skipping over the basics just so I can try to learn a riff to a song I really like.

I've been dabbling into music production over the past few years and I ocasionally share some stuff on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/bizar-re).
