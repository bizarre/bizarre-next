# about me

Hey! I'm Alex! I'm a 22 year old software engineer currently based in beautiful [Vancouver, British Columbia](https://vancouver.ca).

I started writing code at a super young age by creating mods for games like [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net)!

As time went on, the kind of mods I built got more and more complex. Instead of just adding a new entity or item to the game, I was building a distributed FIFO queue over [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com) to facilitate users connecting while the server was full, or a pseudo recorder/player that would capture packets at the network layer so that administrators could play back a 1:1 replay of events for moderation.

These mods that I built were part of an ecosystem of software that, all together, created a super unique experience within the game; an experience that players were willing to pay for. Towards the end of my modding era, I was leading a team of four engineers, building and maintaining software for a gaming product that grossed $2M+ per annum, all before graduating high school.

When the COVID pandemic hit, I co-founded a startup with [my buddy](https://jonahseguin.com) to build the future of media consumption, socially & synchronously. (spoiler alert: it failed, but we're revisiting the core concept as an [open-source project](/repositories/tsanga/orbt) now!).

Most recently, I was an engineer on the Connect Pod @ [Studio](https://studio.com), a learning startup, where I helped build creative profiles, chat, (lots of backfilling), and tons of other cool shit with the most amazing team on this planet. <3

Currently, I'm exploring new opportunities and finding any and all reasons to dabble into cool tech for my personal projects. Please [shoot me an email](mailto:alex@bizar.re) if you've got any dope roles (or, alternatively, [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bizurre) where I shit post and meme).
