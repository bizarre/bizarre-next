# about me

Hey! I'm Alex! I'm a 22 year old software engineer currently based in beautiful [Vancouver, British Columbia](https://vancouver.ca).

I started writing code at a super young age by creating mods for games like [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net)!

By creating these mods, I was able to learn, rather early, a lot about the fundamentals of building and scaling software. As time went on, the kind of mods I built got more and more complex. Instead of adding a new entity or item to the game, I was building a distributed FIFO queue over [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com) to facilitate users connecting while the server was full, or a pseudo recorder/player that would capture packets at the network layer so that administrators could play back a 1:1 replay of events for moderation.

These mods that I built were part of an ecosystem of software that, all together, created a super unqiue experience within the game; an experience that players were willing to pay for. Towards the end of my modding era, I was leading a team of four engineers, producing software for a gaming product that grossed $2M+ per annum, all before graduating high school.

As a self-taught programmer, most of what I knew I learned through trial-and-error (getting my hands dirty) or just through Google searches. I wanted to solidify my CS foundations, so I did a brief stint in college before dropping out a year later after I realized how outdated a lot of what I was being taught was, in respect to current industry practices, and that there were better and less expensive ways to solidify my computer science foundation.

During college & the beginning of the COVID pandemic, I co-founded a startup with [my buddy](https://jonahseguin.com) to build the future of media consumption, socially & synchronously. (spoiler alert: it failed, but we're revisiting the core concept as an [open-source project](https://github.com/tsnaga/orbt) now!).

After college, I joined the Retention Pod @ [Studio](https://studio.com), a learning startup, where I helped build creative profiles, chat, and tons of other cool shit.
