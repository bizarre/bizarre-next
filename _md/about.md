# about me

I have been passionate about programming and technology ever since I was a little kid. I remember being completely captivated by my first computer and spending hours upon hours tinkering with it and learning how to code. As I grew older, I continued to teach myself new languages and technologies, and eventually decided to pursue a career in software engineering.

Aside from my love for programming, I also have a deep interest in music. I have been teaching myself to play the guitar for awhile now, and it is a passion that I truly enjoy. I find that music, much like programming, requires discipline, patience, and a willingness to learn and improve.

In my free time, I also enjoy photography. I have always been fascinated by the way that light and composition can create such beautiful and powerful images. I love experimenting with different camera settings, lenses, and lighting techniques to capture the world around me in new and interesting ways.

When it comes to my professional work, I am particularly interested in everything low level, infrastructure, and the consequences of scale. I love delving into the inner workings of a system and figuring out how to make it run faster, more efficiently, and more reliably. I also love trying out new technologies and experimenting with different approaches to problem-solving.

One of my favorite things about being a software engineer is the ability to build products that people use and enjoy. I love seeing the impact that my work can have on people's lives, and I am constantly striving to improve and learn new things so that I can build even better products in the future.
